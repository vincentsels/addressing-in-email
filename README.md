# Addressing in email

This guide tries to find a common consensus on how to address in emails - both how to use the 'To', 'CC' and 'BCC' fields, as well as how to open and close mails. Feel free to discuss any aspects or suggest improvements using the 'issues'. I hope to, in this way, through civilized reasoning and using common sense, come to a set of common, widely adopted rules and guidelines.

The ultimate goal must always be to eliminate ambiguity, to provide just enough info without being unpolite.

All rules are in bold. Next, some explanation is added as to why this seems to be the most reasonable approach, possibly discussing some alternatives. Finally, each section has some do's and dont's.

These guidelines are in and for English mails, but should be largely transferable to other languages. As a community effort, it should easily be possible to extend these guidelines with language and culture-specific ones where applicable.

## Determining recipients

Before sending a mail, always first think who the recipients should be. This usually already solves most of the problems and amiguity. Generally, a mail should only be sent *to* a single person; or as few people as possible.

### General rule

#### Address whom you expect an action from

If you ask an action to multiple recipients, it's confusing because they might expect from each other that the other person will do it. They are also never sure that if the other person undertook the action, they will notify everyone (reply-all), or not, or whether or not they already started. Therefore, even though you know that multiple persons could do the job, it might be better to address only one person, and ask him to maybe check with another person. Politely ask whether your addressee is the right person for the task; and add that he/she is free to delegate if not.

#### Address whom you expect a response from

Responding to a question is in fact also 'an action', and so it should also only be directed to one person in particular - who might want to delegate.

### Actions or responses from multiple people

Sometimes, you'll want to combine multiple requests around the same topic in one mail. Only do this in case you're sure that *all* the recipients are interested in *all* the info in the mail - otherwise it might be more polite to split it up: that way you don't force people to read texts which they're not interested in, and you avoid people skipping the mail because it's too long. That being said, in some cases it is possibly more efficient to address two or even more people in one mail. We'll talk about how to address them properly further down.

### Informational group mails

Mails that do not require a response or action are typically informational mails. Often, you want to send these to a specific *group*. Further down, we'll see how to specifically address such mails properly. Don't just add a lot of people to the 'to' field!

## To, CC and BCC fields

The main rule is extremely simple:

#### Only put the person you expect an action from in the to-field

A recipient of an email should know whether an action or response is expected from him or her just by looking at whether he appears in the to-field (and is addressed in the mail body).

#### Use the CC field for other people whom you know are interested

Anyone who you know will be interested
